Ques : Analyse spending capacity and pattern of customer

Here we have analysed spending capacity of customer by calculating total amount
spent by a customer’s email id . We see the graph in decreasing order my amount
spent .

Pattern of customer on all the 3 days :

We have analysed the 3 days pattern of a customer shopping by choosing the
customer name in filter .

Ques 2 : Choose potential customers that will spend

The customer purchasing the maximum products seems to be the most active user
and hence we can call it as potential customer .

Ques 3 : Identify product recommendations for customers

For this we will create a new table ‘recomm’ in which we will choose the
customer email id and will find related products purchased by customer .The
related products will be chosen from table ‘category’ . Now table ‘recomm’ will
be my final table which will let me know the suggested products for that
particular email id .

Importing column from table ‘recomm’ :

The suggested product for the particular email id is as shown below :

Choose the email id for whom you want to suggest product in filter .The graph
shows what product can be suggested to these email id .
