Sentiment Data:

Unstructured data on opinions, emotions and attitudes contained in sources like social media, blogs, online product reviews and customer support interactions .

Potential Uses of Sentiment Data :
Organizations use sentiment analysis to understand how the public feels about something at a particular moment in time, and also to track how those opinions change over time. 
An enterprise may analyse sentiment about:

A product – For example, does the target segment understand and appreciate messaging around a product launch?
What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future?

A service – For example, a hotel or restaurant can look into its locations with particularly strong or poor service.

Competitors – In what areas do people see our company as better than (or weaker than) our competition?

Reputation – What does the public really think about our company? Is our reputation positive or negative? 

In this project, we will focus on a product launch. Specifically, we will look at public sentiment 
during the days leading up to and immediately following the recent release of the movie Iron Man 3.

How did the public feel about the debut, and how might that sentiment data have been used to better promote the movie’s launch?

Input Data You can download a set of sample Twitter data contained in a compressed (.zip) folder which was collected from one following way. 

1. The Twitter data was obtained using Flume. Flume can be used as a log aggregator, collecting log data from many diverse sources and moving it to a centralized data store. In this case, Flume was used to capture the Twitter stream data, which we can now load into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HFDS).

2. We can also use R-Hadoop integration and connect R with Twitter to extract the tweets data and upload as json files 

3. We can also collect the reviews from any other social media website using WebCrawler's
