Sentiment Data:

Unstructured data on opinions, emotions and attitudes contained in sources like social media, blogs, online product reviews and customer support interactions .

Potential Uses of Sentiment Data :
Organizations use sentiment analysis to understand how the public feels about something at a particular moment in time, and also to track how those opinions change over time. 
An enterprise may analyse sentiment about:

A product – For example, does the target segment understand and appreciate messaging around a product launch?
What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future?

A service – For example, a hotel or restaurant can look into its locations with particularly strong or poor service.

Competitors – In what areas do people see our company as better than (or weaker than) our competition?

Reputation – What does the public really think about our company? Is our reputation positive or negative? 

In this project, we will focus on a product launch. Specifically, we will look at public sentiment 
during the days leading up to and immediately following the recent release of the movie Iron Man 3.

How did the public feel about the debut, and how might that sentiment data have been used to better promote the movie’s launch?
